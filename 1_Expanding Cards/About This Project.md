# Expanding Cards

This project creates an interactive image panel explorer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When a panel is clicked, it expands to display more information, creating an engaging user experience.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the web page.
- **style.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the project.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript code for interactive functionality.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts based on the screen size. On smaller screens (max-width: 480px), only the first three panels are displayed.
- **Interactive Panels**: Clicking on a panel expands it, while clicking on another panel collapses the previously expanded panel.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Transitions are smoothly animated for better user experience.
